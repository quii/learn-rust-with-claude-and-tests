# Chapter Proposal: Traits

## Business requirement

We want to write a function that prints the area of any shape — rectangle, circle, or anything else we might add later.

## The problem this chapter solves

At the end of the structs chapter, `Rectangle` and `Circle` both have an `area()` method, but they have no connection in the type system. There is no way to write a single function that accepts either. If you tried:

```rust
fn print_area(shape: ???) {
    println!("Area is {}", shape.area());
}
```

There's no type you can put where `???` is. Traits solve this.

## Rust features introduced

- `trait` — defining a shared interface: a named set of method signatures that a type can implement
- `impl Trait for Type` — implementing a trait for a concrete type
- Trait as a parameter type: `fn print_area(shape: &impl Shape)` — the simplest way to accept any type that implements a trait
- The compiler enforcing the contract: if a type claims to implement a trait but is missing a method, it won't compile

## Deferred

- `dyn Trait` / trait objects — dynamic dispatch; deferred to a later chapter
- Generics (`fn foo<T: Trait>`) — equivalent to `impl Trait` syntax but more explicit; mention briefly, defer detail
- Trait bounds with multiple traits (`T: Shape + Debug`)
- Default method implementations in traits
- Traits from the standard library (`Display`, `Debug`, `Iterator`) — mentioned in wrapping up, covered properly later

## Teaching order

1. Establish the problem: write a test for a `print_area` function that takes a `Rectangle`. Make it pass.
2. Now try to write a second test passing a `Circle` — same function, different type. Hit the compiler error.
3. Introduce `trait Shape` with a single method `area(&self) -> f64`. This is the contract.
4. Implement `Shape` for `Rectangle` and `Circle` — `impl Shape for Rectangle`, `impl Shape for Circle`.
5. Update `print_area` to take `shape: &impl Shape`. All tests pass.
6. Add a `Triangle` struct to show how easy it is to extend: implement `Shape`, add a test, done.
7. Wrapping up — mention `dyn Trait` exists; standard library traits teaser.

## Chapter shape

1. **The problem** — `print_area` for Rectangle works; trying to pass Circle fails; what type do we use?
2. **Defining a trait** — `trait Shape`; the contract
3. **Implementing the trait** — `impl Shape for Rectangle`, `impl Shape for Circle`; compiler enforces the contract
4. **`&impl Shape`** — updating the function signature; all tests pass
5. **Adding a Triangle** — extending is cheap; the trait does the work
6. **Wrapping up**

## Teaching notes (from planning)

- The problem must be felt before the solution is shown — write the `print_area(r: Rectangle)` test first, get it green, then try to add the circle test and hit the wall
- `&impl Shape` syntax is the right place to start — it's the simplest and most readable; `dyn` and generics come later
- `impl Shape for Rectangle` mirrors `impl Rectangle` from the previous chapter — same keyword, different purpose; worth noting explicitly
- Triangle step reinforces that the trait is the stable contract; new shapes don't require changing existing code
- The compiler error when a trait implementation is incomplete (`error[E0046]: not all trait items implemented`) is a good teaching moment — show it
- `fn describe_area(shape: &impl Shape) -> String` returning `format!("This shape has an area of {}", shape.area())` — fully testable, no stdout complexity

## Teaching notes (from session)

- This chapter continues in the `structs` crate — no new crate needed
- `describe_area` started taking `Rectangle` by value; when `&impl Shape` was introduced the compiler gave a perfect "consider borrowing here" hint — show this error in the prose
- Float formatting: `{}` drops the decimal point for whole numbers (e.g. `100` not `100.0`) — author decided to test for `"100"` without decimal; prose should acknowledge this briefly
- Author tried `rec: Shape` as the parameter type (without `&` or `impl`) — Rust can't size a bare trait; the compiler suggests `dyn`; use this as the moment to introduce `&impl Shape` as the idiomatic starting point
- `impl Shape for Rectangle` initially delegated to `self.area()` — works but is duplication; moved the implementation directly into the trait impl and removed `area` from `impl Rectangle`/`impl Circle`
- The Go implicit interface comparison came up — worth a sentence in wrapping up: explicit `impl Trait for Type` means you can always see exactly which traits a type satisfies by reading the file; Go's implicit satisfaction means less ceremony; both are deliberate tradeoffs
- Table tests: author's instinct was an array of tuples — right idea, wrong because array elements must be the same type; `Vec<(&str, &dyn Shape, &str)>` is the fix; this is where `dyn Shape` is introduced naturally
- `dyn Shape` vs `&impl Shape`: `&impl Shape` is resolved at compile time (one concrete type); `&dyn Shape` is resolved at runtime (any type, mixed in a collection); `describe_area` updated to take `&dyn Shape` to work with the table test
- Without named cases, a failing table test only shows the values — not which case failed; adding a `&str` name and using `assert_eq!(..., "failed for {}", name)` fixes this; author confirmed the improvement
- Final code: `structs/src/lib.rs` — `Shape` trait, `impl Shape for Rectangle/Circle/Triangle`, `describe_area(&dyn Shape)`, table test with named cases
- `&impl Shape` vs `&dyn Shape`: `&impl Shape` is resolved at compile time — the compiler knows the concrete type, generates specialised code, zero runtime overhead; use it for single-value function parameters. `&dyn Shape` is resolved at runtime via a vtable — small overhead, type is erased, but different types can live in the same collection; use it when you need a heterogeneous collection. Prose should explain this when `dyn` is introduced, not before.
- Table test refactoring: restructuring tests without changing what they assert is valid — the existing tests are the safety net. But after restructuring, deliberately break one assertion to confirm the test still fails correctly and the failure message is useful. An evergreen test that never fails is worthless. This is worth saying explicitly in the prose when the table test is introduced.
